/**
 * Represents a value that could be selected as the desired value for a field.
 *
 * <p>
 * The value property is the value that is submitted when the particular option is selected by the user.
 * Depending on the input control used, this may also be the value that is displayed to the user. Certain
 * controls like a text input with a datalist do not allow the value and label to differ. As such, the label will
 * be ignored and the value will be used both as the displayed text and as the submitted value.
 *
 * <p>
 * The label is the description of the option that is presented to the user. It is from this value that the user
 * must determine if the option is their desired option. Some controls do not allow the label to differ from the
 * value, in those cases, the value will be used instead of the label.
 *
 * <p>
 * The group is a seldom used aspect of an option. Most notably associated with a select control where the group
 * is interpreted as an optGroup value, the group provides a label for distinguishing a group of options. When
 * used, each option in the group must have the same group value. Additionally, multiple options of the same
 * group must be ordered consecutively if they are to be displayed in a single group. Any time a new group is
 * encountered a new group label is displayed.
 *
 * <p>
 * Some controls provide the ability to prevent a particular option from being chosen. When an option is used for
 * one of those controls the enabled property can be used to specify whether a user is allowed or disallowed from
 * selecting the option.
